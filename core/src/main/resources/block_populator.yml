# custom_block:            # The unique ID of a Nexo custom block or Nexo furniture item to be placed.
#   iterations: 50         # Number of placement attempts per chunk. Higher numbers increase the chance of generating the block.
#   worlds: [ world ]      # List of worlds where the custom block can spawn. Example: [ world, world_nether, world_the_end ].
#   maxY: 50               # Maximum Y-level where the custom block can spawn within the chunk.
#   minY: 20               # Minimum Y-level where the custom block can spawn within the chunk.
#   biomes: [ SWAMP ]      # List of biomes where the custom block can spawn. Use an empty list `[]` for all biomes.
#   chance: 0.2            # Probability of the custom block spawning in the chunk. Value ranges from 0.0 (never) to 1.0 (always).
#   replace:               # List of block types that the custom block can replace. Leave empty if not replacing any blocks.
#     - STONE              # Example: Replaces STONE blocks during generation.
#   place_on: [ STONE ]    # Optional: List of block types that the custom block can be placed on. Overrides `replace` if provided.
#   place_below: [ STONE ] # Optional: List of block types that the custom block can be placed below. Overrides `replace` if provided.
#   air_only: false        # Optional: Replace Air only (for place_on and place_below).
#   vein_size: 5           # Optional: Maximum number of blocks in a vein. Set to 0 for single block placement. Default: 0.
#   cluster_chance: 0.8    # Optional: Probability of cluster (vein) formation within the chunk. Defaults to 0.0 for no clustering.
